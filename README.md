#### About the Game
This is the final Blackjack version of [Tealeaf Academy's](http://www.gotealeaf.com") first course. The previous versions, which can be found [here](https://github.com/XiaoA/Ruby_Blackjack), include:

1. A [procedural Blackjack game](https://github.com/XiaoA/Ruby_Blackjack/blob/master/blackjack.rb), written in Ruby.
2. An [Object-Oriented Blackjack game](https://github.com/XiaoA/Ruby_Blackjack/blob/master/oop_blackjack.rb), refactored from the procedural version.

This version takes the lessons learned from those programs, and applies to them a webapp, built with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), and deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
